Notes about how to import modules/files in python

- Note that a python module is sometimes just another way of saying python file.




- Example Files:
    1. Importing a single function from a file
    2. Importing everything from a single file
    3. Importing entire python file from another folder
    4. Importing all python files from a folder
    5. Importing a file from a nested folder
    6. Importing a module using 'as'
    7. Dealing with relative imports and ones that go up a directory
